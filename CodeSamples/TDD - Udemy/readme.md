Course from: https://www.udemy.com/course/test-driven-development-in-ios-using-swift/?couponCode=MT40825A

What should you test? 
- DO test Application Domain (business logic)
- DON'T test generated code (code that gets created from code)
- DON'T test issues caught by compiler
- DON'T test dependencies of third-party code
- DO test app user interface by automating unit tests


When should you use TDD?
- Greenfield development (new projects)
- Brownfield development (legacy)
- Understanding the domain (helps you understand the domain)
- Hackathons (evaluate if you have time - probably not)


What are bad unit tests?


What are good unit tests?
- Independent - not rely on other tests or a sequence of other tests.
- They should be automatic. No need to be manually ran. 
- Should consistently get the same results. 
- Should be readable.
