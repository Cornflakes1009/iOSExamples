SwiftUI template doesn't include a Launch Screen. File > New File > Launch Screen > Project > General tab > App Icons and Launch Screen > choose Launch Screen file. 

@State properties are the source of truth for the view they're declared on. When the value of a @State property changes, the views get redrawn. 

@Binding properties creates a 2 way connection between an existing source of truth and a view that displays and updates the data. This keeps multiple views in sync.
