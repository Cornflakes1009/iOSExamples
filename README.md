- Project 2: A collection view project with a header that shrinks as you scroll down and grows as you scroll up. 

- Project 3: A project that connects directly with Spotify. This app just requests persmission to authenticate with Spotify and can open the Spotify app. It's the groundwork for making a custom Spotify app. This must be ran on a physical device with Spotify installed.
