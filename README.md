https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez4cQWx-q9o&list=PLEVREFF3xBv6B8HTm_ED-8fok5DjQe6sQ

- Project 1: A multi-collection view project with an animated page indicator. The indicator underlines each page as it is swiped to. 

- Project 2: A collection view project with a header that shrinks as you scroll down and grows as you scroll up. 

- Project 3: A project that connects directly with Spotify. This app just requests persmission to authenticate with Spotify and can open the Spotify app. It's the groundwork for making a custom Spotify app. This must be ran on a physical device with Spotify installed. 


## Starbucks
iOS Project that uses UIKit and is a clone of the Starbucks app. This has some great animations and a somewhat complicated view drawn with Core Graphics. Doesn't play nicely with light/dark mode so may need to switch between the two. CMD + SHIFT + A.

## BiometricAuthExample
iOS Project using Face Id and Touch Id to authenticate. Loosely based on the below tutorial. The solution doesn't handle Apple's default response to Face/Touch Id failing. To use Face Id in the simulator, go to Features > Face Id > Enroll and then Features > Face Id > Matching or Non-Matching Face accordingly.
