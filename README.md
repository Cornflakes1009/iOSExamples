- Project 2: A collection view project with a header that shrinks as you scroll down and grows as you scroll up. 

- Project 3: A project that connects directly with Spotify. This app just requests persmission to authenticate with Spotify and can open the Spotify app. It's the groundwork for making a custom Spotify app. This must be ran on a physical device with Spotify installed.

## BiometricAuthExample
iOS Project using Face Id and Touch Id to authenticate. Loosely based on the below tutorial. The solution doesn't handle Apple's default response to Face/Touch Id failing. To use Face Id in the simulator, go to Features > Face Id > Enroll and then Features > Face Id > Matching or Non-Matching Face accordingly.
